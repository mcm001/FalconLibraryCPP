# FalconLibraryC++

This project is a C++ version of the more-popular Kotlin JVM library -- [FalconLibrary](https://github.com/5190GreenHopeRobotics/FalconLibrary/).

Features of FalconLibraryC++ that are similar to FalconLibraryJVM:
 * 2d geometry
 * Arc-length parameterization of splines using recursive subdivision of arcs (from team 254)
 * Trajectory generation with constraints on velocity and acceleration
 
Features of FalconLibraryC++ that are superior to FalconLibraryJVM:
 * Use of templates for more powerful generic library code
 * Use of compile-time unit safety (no runtime penalty)
 
Features yet to be added to FalconLibraryC++ that FalconLibraryJVM has:
 * DifferentialDrive model
 * 3d
 * WPILib and FRC specific wrappers
 * Unit models
